### Objectives:
- Using ES7 Async functions and Promises
- Functional programming
- Object-oriented design using ES6 classes
- Code organization with ES6 modules in Javascript
- Using Webpack for compiling Javascript modules
- DOM manipulation

## Features
The 2D-game is a platform game based on the tutorial by Marijn Haverbeke in the 3rd Edition of the book- Eloquent Javascript. The 
game is played using keyboard `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right` arrows. The game supports longer key presses for increased range of movement. The `player` is a basic rectangular block and a user is faced with the task of collecting coins in a course with `lava` as obstacles. The `player` glows and the next level appears if a user wins. If a `player` touches the `lava`, the user has lost. An animated frame will be displayed before the level is restarted. Further implementation will add scores. The 2D-game currently supports screen sizes from iPad Mini and above.
